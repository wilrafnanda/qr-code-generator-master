# qr-code-generator-master
HERE in this project i was creating a QRCODE generator using QRCODE.JS
Some difficulties faced was implementing the create qrcode function due to the designe of my html and javascript

to solved that i had to implement and test each functions as seperate files before joining them 
- create qrcode to render the qr code depending on the input text
- the downloa function in which i found many difficultieas to render the image in png format but by testing it in seperate files i could figure it out ðŸ˜Ž
- the share funcyion which helps to copy the image in the clipboardðŸ‘Œ
